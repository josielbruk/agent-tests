- **Open Source Foundation:** Linux is built on open-source principles, allowing anyone to view, modify, and distribute its source code, which fosters rapid innovation and security through community collaboration.
- **Kernel Architecture:** Linux uses a monolithic kernel architecture, where the kernel handles all core system functions (process management, memory management, device drivers) in a single address space, providing high performance and direct hardware access.
- **Package Management System:** Linux distributions employ sophisticated package managers (like APT, YUM, or Pacman) that handle software installation, updates, and dependency resolution automatically, ensuring system consistency and security through centralized repositories.
- **Security and Permissions:** Linux implements a robust multi-user security model with strict ownership and permission controls, ensuring that users and applications operate with the least privilege required to maintain system integrity.
- **Modularity:** Linux supports loadable kernel modules, enabling users to add or remove functionality (like device drivers) without rebooting the system, enhancing flexibility and ease of maintenance.
- **File System Support:** Linux supports a wide variety of file systems (ext4, XFS, Btrfs, etc.), allowing users to choose the best file system for their needs based on performance, reliability, and features.
